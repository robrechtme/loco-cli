description: Keep your translations in sync with Loco
---

The **loco-cli** helps you keep your translations bundled in your app/website in sync with [Loco](https://localise.biz).

## Commands

loco-cli has three commands, similar to git:

- `loco-cli pull` - Download all translations from Loco
- `loco-cli push` - Push local translations to Loco
- `loco-cli status` - See which translations are out of sync

## Translation File Format

loco-cli expects your translations to be stored as **JSON** files, one for each language:

```
locales/
├── en.json
├── es.json
└── fr.json
```

Keys in the files are asset IDs, and values are translations. Nested JSON structures produce dotted asset IDs:

```json
{
  "home": {
    "title": "Welcome back, {{name}}"
  }
}
```

The nested `home.title` key becomes the asset ID `home.title` in Loco.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx loco-cli --help
```

See the [Installation](/installation) guide to get started.
