description: Upload translations to Loco
---

Push local translation changes to Loco. Depending on your `push` options, this will add new translations, modify existing ones, or delete translations from Loco that aren't in your local files.

```bash
loco-cli push
```

## Options

### `-y, --yes`

Automatically answer yes to all confirmation prompts.

```bash
loco-cli push -y
```

### `--experimental-push-all`

Upload all locales in a single API request instead of one request per locale. This can significantly improve performance for projects with many locales by reducing API calls from N (one per locale) to 1.

```bash
loco-cli push --experimental-push-all
```

Can also be set via `push.experimentalPushAll` in config.

## Push Options

Configure push behavior in `loco.config.js` under the `push` key. See [Configuration](/configuration#push-options) for details.

### Example: Tag new assets

```js
// loco.config.js
module.exports = {
  accessKey: '<key>',
  localesDir: 'src/locales',
  push: {
    'flag-new': 'provisional',
    'tag-new': 'v1.2.0'
  }
};
```
