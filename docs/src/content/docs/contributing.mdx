---

Contributions are welcome! Here's how to get started.

## Development Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

To test the CLI locally:

```bash
pnpm loco-cli <command>
```

## Before Submitting a PR

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
```

## Code Style

- 2-space indent, 100 char width, single quotes, semicolons required
- Prefer typed code over `any`
- No barrel exports; use explicit imports

## Publishing (Maintainers)

1. Go to **Actions → Release workflow**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select version type (patch/minor/major)

The workflow runs tests, bumps the version, publishes to npm via OIDC trusted publishing, and creates a GitHub Release.
